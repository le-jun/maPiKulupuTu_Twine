This creative work by Lejun is a digital port of the book [MaPiKulupuTu](https://janketami.wordpress.com/2021/06/13/ma-pi-kulupu-tu-toki-pi-nasin-sina/) by R.Samys which itself is a COYA book based on the official Toki Pona book and [website](http://tokipona.org).

# ToDo
* Events port is still in progress and halfway done (120/2xx).
* Events containing Lipamanka font is tagged under Twine and will be handled later on with pictures support.
* Authors will be contacted to see what can be done about reusing the cover, and "the Labyrinth". which arenâ€™t under CC-BY.
* A text review and layout rework will be necessary afterwards to ensure better lisibility.
* Conversion to an apk is planned for distribution on f-droid.
